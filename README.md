# CalorieTracker (umbrella repo)

This repository is an aggregator for the CalorieTracker backend, frontend, and planning assets.
It exists so automation tools, free-provider subagents, and local testing can operate from a single sandbox-friendly path that contains the three subsystems as subdirectories.

## Layout (stage 1)

- `backend/` – mirror of `CalorieTracker_BackEnd`
- `frontend/` – mirror of `CalorieTracker_FrontEnd`
- `plan/` – mirror of `CalorieTracker_Plan`
- `scripts/` – helpers for synchronizing and managing the mirrors

In Stage 1 we focus on scaffolding the structure, keeping each mirror in sync with the authoritative repo, and ensuring the aggregator can serve as the single entry point for future Stage 2 automation work.

## Sync workflow

Use `scripts/sync_repos.sh` (stage 1) to pull the latest files from the `_BackEnd`, `_FrontEnd`, and `_Plan` repos into this aggregator.
It preserves the upstream `node_modules`, `.git`, and other autogenerated artifacts out of the copies, so the aggregated tree stays clean.

## What’s next

1. Confirm the mirrors contain the expected files (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `plan/`).
2. After Stage 1 is complete, we will treat `/Users/luis/Repos/CalorieTracker` as the new root for `Start CalorieTracker` and the free-cycle skills.
3. Future documentation will describe how to regenerate the original repos from these mirrors when needed.

## Stage 2: Running from this root

- After you sync the mirrors, run `npm install` inside both `backend/` and `frontend/` so the node modules and compiled artifacts are available (`cd backend && npm install`, `cd frontend && npm install`).
- Use `scripts/start_calorietracker.sh` to start the backend/postgres stack from `/Users/luis/Repos/CalorieTracker`; it now builds the backend, runs migrations, and launches the frontend so you get the same URLs as before (`:3000` for the UI and `:4000` for the health endpoint).
- After the stack is running, the URLs are still the familiar ones:
  - Frontend: `http://<your local IP>:3000`
  - Backend health: `http://<your local IP>:4000/health`
- When documenting or scripting future work, treat this repo as the canonical workspace and refer to the `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `plan/` subdirectories instead of the legacy `_BackEnd`, `_FrontEnd`, and `_Plan` paths.

## Legacy paths

Some existing markdown files still mention the previous repo paths (`CalorieTracker_BackEnd`, `CalorieTracker_FrontEnd`, `CalorieTracker_Plan`). Treat those as historical references that predate this aggregator; once the new repo is published we will update or reframe the old docs accordingly.
