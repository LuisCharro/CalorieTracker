# CalorieTracker Research Pack

## Purpose

This research pack documents learnings from Chris Raroque's YouTube channel about building **Amy** - a food journal/calorie-tracking iOS app. The goal is to extract practical product and engineering insights to inform the design of our own CalorieTracker app.

## Timeline

**Anchor Video**: October 10, 2025 - "I Built An App In 12 Hours" (initial Amy app build)

**Current Status**: February 2026 - "How My App Is Doing (2 Month Update)" (latest update)

## Scope

This research focuses on:
- Product decisions made during Amy's development
- Technical architecture and implementation choices
- Mistakes, pivots, and lessons learned
- User acquisition and monetization strategies
- Design and UX considerations

## What This Is NOT

- **Not** a code implementation guide
- **Not** a feature-by-feature copy of Amy
- **Not** a direct clone attempt

Instead, this is about understanding the **why** behind decisions to make better choices for our app.

## File Organization

1. **00_README.md** (this file) - Overview and purpose
2. **01_video_index.md** - Chronological index of relevant videos with key takeaways
3. **02_learnings_synthesis.md** - Consolidated insights by theme
4. **03_product_decisions_checklist.md** - Pre-implementation checklist
5. **04_risks_and_unknowns.md** - Open questions and assumptions
6. **05_next_research_questions.md** - Priority research items before coding

## Data Sources

- YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@raroque
- Anchor Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpF_EtwB8tc
- App Store: Amy Food Journal (iOS)

## Methodology

- Analyzed video titles, descriptions, and available transcripts
- Extracted comments and community discussions
- Synthesized themes across the video timeline
- Separated facts from assumptions where possible

## Note on Limitations

Some video transcripts were not accessible. Where full content is unavailable, insights are based on:
- Video titles and descriptions
- Chapter headings
- Comment discussions
- Cross-references between videos

Uncertain areas are explicitly marked in the analysis.
