Generated: 2026-02-20T14:03:00.4756997+00:00 UTC

## Overview
This note captures the immediate backend/frontend todo list for the upcoming free cycle. Focus: Addressing highest-priority pending items from execution readiness checklist.

## Backend Tasks

Priority 1: MVP Flow Definitions & Validation
- Define and document route guards for all frontend pages (signup, login, today, history, settings, goals, onboarding)
- Define lifecycle states for each page (unauthenticated, authenticating, authenticated, loading, error)
- Ensure food logging flow (parse/confirm/save/edit/delete) is fully specified and accepted in execution plan
- Document meal item identity rule for `/today/meal/[id]` endpoint

Priority 2: Security & Compliance Documentation
- Document access control model for user-scoped data (who can access what)
- Document retention + erasure timing policies:
  - 7-day retention for daily logs
  - 30-day grace period for GDPR erasure
  - Immediate erasure for explicit user deletion requests
- Document data export format (JSON required, CSV optional)

Priority 3: Platform & Operations
- Document local-first dev workflow and cloud promotion path in execution plan
- Define backup/restore expectations for beta/prod environments
- Document operational triggers (paid tier, queue, architecture split) and ownership for incident handling
- Assign ownership for GDPR request handling

## Frontend Tasks

Priority 1: Route Guards & Lifecycle Implementation
- Implement route guards based on backend definitions
- Implement lifecycle states for all pages
- Test unauthenticated access redirection (signup/login)
- Test authenticated access protection for protected routes
- Ensure loading states are properly handled

Priority 2: UX Outcomes Definition
- Define GDPR export UX outcomes (what user sees, what format, how it's delivered)
- Define GDPR erasure UX outcomes (what user sees, confirmation flow, timeline)
- Define MVP exclusions list and ensure they are not mixed into MVP acceptance criteria

## Quality Assurance

- Run smoke tests after changes: `dev-scripts/smoke-auth-onboarding.sh`
- Run unit tests: `npm test`
- Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` (Tier A + Tier B)
- Verify no regressions after changes
