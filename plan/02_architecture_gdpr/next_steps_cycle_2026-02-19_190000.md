# Next Steps Note — Cycle 2026-02-19_190000

Generated: 2026-02-19T18:00:00.000000+00:00 UTC

## Overview
This note captures the immediate backend/frontend todo list for the upcoming free cycle, focusing on frontend integration of the newly implemented onboarding completion endpoint.

## Backend Tasks
- ✅ Onboarding completion endpoint implemented (cycle 36)
- Run /Users/luis/Repos/CalorieTracker/backend/dev-scripts/smoke-auth-onboarding.sh to verify stability
- Run `npm test` under timeout guards (see the runbook)

## Frontend Tasks
- Review 05_quality_automation/02_frontend_e2e_matrix.md and ensure selectors match the current UI
- Wire up onboarding completion page (`/onboarding/complete/page.tsx`) to call `PUT /api/settings/:userId/onboarding`
- Add E2E test for complete onboarding flow including the new completion endpoint
- Run /Users/luis/Repos/CalorieTracker/frontend/dev-scripts/restart-stack.sh (if needed) and `npm run test:e2e` to validate

## Specific Implementation Goal

The onboarding completion flow should:
1. User completes goals → preferences → consents
2. User reaches `/onboarding/complete` page
3. Frontend calls `PUT /api/settings/:userId/onboarding`
4. On success, redirect user to `/today` (main app)
5. User now has full access to app features
