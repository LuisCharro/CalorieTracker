## My App Hit $1000/mo (But We Have A Problem)

Chris reports a fast early win: *We have a 100 paying users and that's about $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue.* The core problem is retention—*We're sitting at about an 8% week 1 retention rate,* so getting more downloads alone won’t help unless people keep using the app. His north star is to push that week‑1 retention toward roughly 30–40% by fixing the onboarding and core experience.

To address churn he prioritized user feedback and shipped three practical changes. Photo-based food logging: a quick prototype that takes a picture, generates a natural‑language description, and then uses a separate lookup step to populate calories—users can edit the description or portion size and optionally tag a restaurant for more accurate results. Micronutrient tracking: users can now enable sugar, fiber, and other micronutrients selectively and set targets; this was added into onboarding and produced immediate “magic moments” (e.g., revealing unexpectedly high sugar intake). Both features were lightweight to ship and aimed at reducing friction and creating educational insights that build trust.

Behind the scenes he reworked the calorie calculation pipeline to improve correctness, speed, and cost. Originally every add/edit triggered a full web‑search lookup, which caused surprising, inconsistent results when users made simple portion edits. He moved to a multi‑AI approach: a cheap, fast classifier handles routine edits (portion changes, multipliers) and does predictable numeric adjustments, while only more complex edits invoke the full web‑search model. That change makes edits behave as users expect, is noticeably faster, and cuts per‑edit cost substantially. Chris will keep talking to users, monitor week‑1 retention closely, and experiment with user‑generated content channels while iterating on the product.
