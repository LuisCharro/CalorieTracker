## Summary

*“One week into launch, we are at around $400 monthly recurring revenue.”* Chris launched Amy, a minimal, note‑style calorie tracker and tracked every metric for the first week. The headline: ~$400 MRR in week one, but deeper metrics revealed big friction points—only 40% of downloaders initially completed account signup, and just 5% of signups converted to a paid trial. After targeted changes, recent downloads showed the signup rate rising to essentially 100% for that cohort.

Chris prioritized low‑friction authentication and product signals of quality to move those numbers. He added platform single‑sign‑on options (so users don’t have to type an email), built a system‑level health integration that pulls workouts/steps/calories and writes calorie data back, and surfaced those stats in a new weekly overview and goals bar inside the app. He also flipped the onboarding flow so users complete personalization before being asked to create an account, and reworked the paywall: when users dismiss it, they now receive a 24‑hour free trial (no credit card) to reduce immediate churn from the paywall clickthrough—60% had been dismissing the paywall before this change.

The result: clearer product signals and lower friction where it mattered, plus fast iteration—several features were implemented in an hour thanks to dictation and developer productivity tooling. Chris is tracking everything in analytics, plans more integrations (example: watch support) and onboarding tweaks, and will only scale paid user acquisition once conversion rates improve to make marketing spend efficient. *“how many people after they downloaded the app continued and actually signed up for the app”* is the core question he’s pushing to improve; the video is a practical, metric‑driven look at the first‑week wins, the surprising failures, and the specific fixes he shipped to raise long‑term retention and revenue.
