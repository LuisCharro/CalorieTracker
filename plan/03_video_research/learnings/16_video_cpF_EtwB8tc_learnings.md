## Quick summary
Chris spent a day building a small calorie-tracking app to experiment with Apple’s new liquid glass UI and on-device foundation models. The interface shows inline calorie estimates to the right of whatever you type (like “In‑N‑Out Burger with fries”), includes a daily-calorie target, haptics and liquid-glass transitions, and a simple settings screen. *"It's a calorie tracking app, but with a twist."*

## Key findings and technical approach
Integrating Apple’s Foundation models was trivial and runs locally and privately, but accuracy for nutrition estimation was poor (example: the model estimated ~840 calories for an item that’s ~300 calories on the restaurant site). Chris tested local open-source models via llm.sswift (Llama and a Gemma/GMA variant): marginal accuracy gains but much heavier downloads (~2 GB) and significantly worse on-device performance. Cloud models (Gemini, Claude variants) improved accuracy further, so he combined model outputs with external nutrition data: a lightweight model extracts foods and portions from the user text, then the app queries a nutrition database API and returns exact calories after the model does the math. *"Apple Foundation models would be perfect for this. They're free. They run locally and are completely private."*

## Secondary details, tradeoffs, and outcome
Using FatSecret’s nutrition API made results much more reliable but proved expensive for commercial use (Chris cites about $1,500/month minimum or a free tier that requires prominent branding). He then discovered Perplexity Sonar, a model that runs live searches and aggregates nutrition data and restaurant pages; Sonar proved very accurate and returns sources, which increases trust in the numbers, but its search-request pricing (~$5 per 1,000 searches) can be costly. Overall takeaway: Apple’s on-device models are fast and well-integrated for iPhone UI work but aren’t trained for domain-specific nutrition facts; hybrid designs (entity extraction locally + authoritative nutrition lookups or a search-enabled model) deliver the best accuracy. Chris put up a waitlist after positive interest and plans a beta; the project refreshed him creatively while clarifying where each model type fits for mobile apps.
