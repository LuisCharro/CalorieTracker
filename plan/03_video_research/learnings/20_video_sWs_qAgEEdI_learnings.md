## I Got My First 10 Users (And What I Did Next)

Chris got his first 10 users (five from a waitlist, five chosen for candid feedback) and spent one week iterating to improve retention and prepare for the next 200 signups. The main priorities were: make onboarding less overwhelming, fix stability and edge cases, reduce repetitive friction (quick-add/saved meals), enable easy editing of nutrition results, and put analytics and a feedback board in place to guide prioritization. *"there's a lot of interest in this app. There's like a thousand people on the wait list."*

Key changes and why they matter: he rebuilt parts of the stack to stop crashes and data loss, added offline support with a visible offline indicator and queued processing so entries typed offline aren’t lost, and added timezone support so entries land on the correct day. He spent significantly more time on onboarding—creating hand-drawn, animated illustrations to make a longer onboarding feel engaging rather than tedious—and reported that testers reacted very positively, with at least one signing up twice just to repeat it. *"I was able to quickly support offline mode."*

Product and retention mechanics: he instrumented product analytics to track week-1 retention, the percentage of users performing the core action (logging food), reminder opt-ins, and per-user cost of AI processing; early dashboards showed about 73% of new signups logged food and roughly half opted into reminders, which points to optimization opportunities. Feature work included a one-tap saved-meals quick-add (reduces repeated typing and API calls), an edit-request flow so users can ask the system to adjust nutrition estimates and approve/reject changes, and an in-app feedback board that lets users submit and upvote ideas so the highest-demand features bubble up. He closed by thanking the testers and planning to repeat the same feedback-driven onboarding process when ramping to the next 200 users.
