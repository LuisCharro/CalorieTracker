## How My App Is Doing (2 Month Update)

Chris summarizes two months of running Amy, an AI-powered calorie tracker that feels like Apple Notes: the app reached about $1,500 in monthly recurring revenue from 148 paid subscribers (last 28 days $1,968), but initial AI costs nearly killed margins. *It has not been the smoothest experience.* After starting with an AI bill around $700/month, changes cut that to $221 while usage increased, improving the AI profit margin from roughly 50% to about 85% and making the overall business sustainably profitable once other hosting and operating costs are included.

The cost wins came from two engineering changes: route simple edits to a much cheaper model (Gemini 2.5 flashlight) instead of calling the expensive search model every time, and add caching in the database so repeated food queries reuse stored nutrition data. The cheaper model reduced per-edit cost from ~0.5¢ to ~0.1¢, and caching produced a 60–70% cache hit rate, which was the main driver of the large bill reduction. Chris also added a menu-scanning feature that extracts menu items and descriptions using Gemini 2.5 flashlight, plus about ten small UX fixes, weight tracking with progress photos, improved export and Apple Health syncing, and smarter notifications (he fixed a data collection bug to store timestamps so notifications can become time-aware). Cost monitoring and per-model breakdowns were used to validate these changes and catch regressions.

Retention is the central metric: initial week-one retention was very low, *"week one retention was about 3%,"* later rising to 8% after early fixes and then to 10.2% after the recent round of improvements. Chris’s target remains 30–40% week-one retention for a breakout product, so the roadmap focuses on reducing friction (explicit edit buttons, better photo editing flow), increasing switching cost (weight history and photos), and smarter, less annoying notifications to keep engagement. Bottom line: revenue is growing, AI costs are mostly solved, retention is improving incrementally, and the project is now profitable and positioned for continued iteration.
