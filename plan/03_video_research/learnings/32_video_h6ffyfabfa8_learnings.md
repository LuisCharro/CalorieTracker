## Why the creator switched from Supabase to Convex

This video argues Convex is a far better fit than Supabase for nontechnical builders who rely on AI to generate and change app code. The creator lists five reasons: Convex keeps database schema, rules, and business logic inside the app code (so an AI can see and edit everything), it provides automatic free development and production sandboxes, its pricing is usage-based and friendlier to experimentation, it streamlines integrations with external services by treating backend code as code that syncs to the cloud, and it offers built-in reactivity so clients update instantly. *"It's like having a TV that needs two different remotes."*  

Key supporting facts and examples: with Supabase you must manage separate code and a dashboard-driven database, which forces AI workflows to jump between contexts and can leave you manually clicking dashboard buttons. The creator describes a long-running project (CourseFly) where setting up a staging environment on Supabase was onerous, which led to shipping bugs or avoiding changes; he also reports unexpectedly high costs (about $80/month) after upgrading an organization because Supabase’s organization-based billing converts free projects into paid ones. Convex, by contrast, gives two environments automatically, includes many free projects that never freeze, charges by actual usage, and synchronizes local code to a managed cloud backend so you don't need temporary internet tunnels or ad-hoc bridge tools. *"Convex gives you a super safe place to fail for free."*  

Secondary details and conclusions: Convex’s reactivity means UI updates propagate instantly without extra setup, reducing the extra code and fragility that typically burdens nontechnical builders; that lower friction makes iterative, AI-driven development faster and less error-prone. The creator’s overall claim is practical: if you build apps with AI or expect to experiment frequently, Convex reduces context-switching, testing friction, accidental bills, and integration headaches compared with Supabase, producing snappier, more reliable user experiences.
