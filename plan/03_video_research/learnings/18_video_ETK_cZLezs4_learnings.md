## Summary

*I gave myself one week to take this prototype and make it a fully functioning app that people could use.* Chris started from a 12-hour prototype of a calorie-tracking app that mirrors a notes-style interface (text entry on the left, calorie results on the right), posted it, and got an unexpectedly large response and a waitlist of hundreds. He decided to turn the prototype into a real iOS beta in one week, with the explicit goal of shipping a stable core experience and onboarding the first users to collect feedback.

The first priorities were stability and polish: the visible UI used two synchronized scroll views and required multiple rewrites to handle edge cases (multi-line text, offline or slow server responses, scroll desync), plus a day of animation and interaction tuning. *The AI is not the hard part of this app.* The AI-powered search and calorie-lookup were already functioning via an external search/LLM service, so most effort went into UX: a nutrition detail page built to inspire trust (breakdowns of nutrients, the original sources the AI consulted, and an “Amy’s thought process” explanation of how a calorie estimate was derived), goals and macronutrient targets (including an AI-assisted suggestion flow to generate targets), basic notification scheduling to support logging habits, location-aware lookups so the AI can disambiguate local restaurants, and an integrated dictation input using the platform’s native dictation (noted as less accurate than specialized dictation tools). One planned feature—an in-place AI chat to edit calorie estimates—was started but cut from the initial beta to meet the one-week deadline.

On the infrastructure side he added persistent storage and a backend: a hosted database and a simple server that the app calls for AI-related work, not the client directly. He emphasized the security best practice of routing LLM/API calls through a backend rather than embedding keys or calling models from the mobile app, and implemented AI-cost protections including invisible per-user daily/weekly/monthly limits, a remote kill switch to disable AI features for any account, and cost tracking/analytics to detect abuse or bugs. After hooking everything up he submitted the build to the platform’s beta distribution system, received approval, and onboarded five beta testers; next steps are to collect feedback, expand the beta cohort, refine pricing and features, and iterate on the experience.
