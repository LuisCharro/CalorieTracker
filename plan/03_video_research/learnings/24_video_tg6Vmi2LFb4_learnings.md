## Amy — launch recap and what mattered

Chris ships a new calorie-tracking app called Amy that works like a Notes-style food journal: you type what you ate and the app finds and displays calories. *Amy is finally live on the app store.* He accelerated the public launch because running the beta at scale was costing him money — he lost about $300 in a week and, with 1,500 people still on the waitlist, *"I was projected to lose a lot more than that if I onboard those next 1500 users."* That cash pressure pushed him to start monetizing sooner than planned.

The core product was already feature-complete with widgets, streaks, and basic tracking; the last major piece was monetization. He chose $10/month or $100/year with a 3-day free trial because the AI models driving calorie lookups make per-user costs high (estimated $4–8/month for normal use, up to $14–15 for power users). To improve conversions he designed a multi-screen paywall with a playful animation, a three-step “trial timeline” that sets expectations, and a short transparency blurb explaining pricing. Other launch work included polished App Store screenshots (iPad-specific ones included), a landing page and legal pages to satisfy App Store rules, an email workflow system for onboarding/retention, and an in-app account/data deletion option to meet review requirements.

Submission hit two rejections before approval: first for how the yearly price was displayed (monthly-equivalent prominence), then for missing terms/privacy links in the app description; both were fixed and the app passed review in about 72 hours. Launch was low-key (a single tweet) and produced ~50 trial starts in day one, many of them quick cancellations, but a few users remained active. Chris plans follow-up videos sharing retention, conversion metrics, and marketing plans now that the app is live.
