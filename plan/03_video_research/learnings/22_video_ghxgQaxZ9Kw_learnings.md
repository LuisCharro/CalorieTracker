## We Built An App And Got 100 Users! — summary

*My newest app, Amy, finally has 100 users.* The creator built a simple Notes-style calorie tracker and used a prelaunch wait list (about 1,600 people) to recruit the first testers. After onboarding 100 users the key insight was week‑1 retention: roughly 3% of new users were still active after one week, so the immediate goal became improving retention before adding the next 500 users. *"retention is how many people stick with and continue to use your app."*

To raise retention quickly he focused on three types of work delivered in about a week: product hooks, gamification, and stability. Widgets (home and lock screen) were added so the app appears frequently on users' phones and tapping the widget opens the app for fast logging, reducing friction. Streaks, a calendar view, and collectible animated badges were introduced to encourage daily habit formation. Crucial bug fixes targeted real problems that erode trust: inline nutrition edits sometimes failed to persist, some calorie calculations and quick-add totals didn’t update reliably, and missing settings (no place to input weight/height or switch metric/imperial) were fixed and onboarding updated to collect those values. He also sped up development by using dictation and AI-assisted coding workflows to ship features faster.

With these changes he’s ready to onboard 500 more users and remeasure week‑1 retention; future work includes improving notifications, accuracy of the nutrition data, and further widget/engagement features ahead of an app store launch. The video documents concrete fixes and early product decisions aimed squarely at turning initial curiosity into a habit-forming experience.
