Every AI coding tutorial tells you the
exact same thing. Use Superbase. And I
believed it, too. I built apps with it.
I even taught it. But after helping over
200 non-technical professionals build
real apps with AI, I've realized that
this advice is actually holding you
back. What I use now is called Convex.
And in this video, I'm going to show you
the five reasons why I switched and why
your AI tools will thank you for doing
the same. And to make things even
easier, I made a Convex starter guide
for you that you can download for free
later in this video. So here is reason
number one. So as a nontechnical builder
using AI, you really want things to be
simple. But with Superbase, you're
forced to manage two separate brains. On
one side, you have your code where your
app lives with login and actual
features. And on the other, you have the
Superbase dashboard and database where
your tables, data, and rules live. So
your AI coder is constantly switching
between asking your AI to write code and
then if you got it set up talking
directly to Superbase or in the worst
case waiting for you to manually click
some buttons in a dashboard to make
things work. It's like having a TV that
needs two different remotes. One
controls the picture and the other
controls the sound. Sometimes they sync,
sometimes they don't. And every time you
want to change something, you juggle
them both. Convex solves this by giving
you one single remote, which is your
app's code. Your database rules, your
table definitions, and your business
logic all live right there alongside
your app. This is where the AI can
actually see it, understand it, and
change it instantly without wasting time
or memory, leading to much better
results. And now that your AI can
actually see everything, there's one new
problem because you are going to break
things quite a lot, which brings us to
reason number two. So, as you already
know, while you're building with AI,
things break a lot. So, you need
something that developers call a
sandbox. In traditional engineering,
setting up a deaf or a staging
environment, as it's called, is quite
complicated. Superbase is no difference
because it requires you to configure
this manually and even pay for it extra
just to have a safe place to test. I
used to run something called CourseFly,
an online learning platform on
Superbase. It had hundreds of paying
users yet because it was such a pain in
the ass to actually set up the testing
environment that I never did. And this
resulted in me shipping some bugs, more
than some bugs, or actually not
implementing changes because I didn't
have the brain space to plan and extend
that app so that it wouldn't break after
I pushed it live without a testing
environment. And if you don't know, I
have over 20 years of experience as a
developer and even for me, the friction
was too high. I could do it but it was
too complicated. Not only that but
Superbase as I said will also charge you
for the pleasure of having a testing
environment which is like an additional
project which you'll understand in a
moment. Meanwhile, Convex not only gives
you a separate development and
production environment completely
automatically but it does so for free.
The second you start a new project these
two environments are just waiting for
you. So you don't have to configure
anything and you can break your
development environment all day long
without your user ever noticing that you
did. This is how it should be. So Convex
gives you a super safe place to fail for
free. But what happens when you are
ready to pay? Well, this is where
Superbase becomes a real problem. And
trust me, this matters even if you're
like me and you don't mind paying for
things that are actually worth it
because Superbase punishes you for
having ideas. Their free plan limits you
to two active projects. And if you want
to test a third one, a fourth one, or a
fifth one, you have to delete or at
least pause one of the old projects,
making them temporarily inaccessible.
But the real kick in the nuts happens
when you do decide to give Superbase
money because their billing is
organizationbased. And the moment you
upgrade an organization, which you can
think of as a group of projects to the
pro plan, you lose the rights to have
any free projects in that organization.
Think about it like this. If you have
five hobby projects and you decide to
upgrade one of them to the pro plan,
they will all automatically be converted
into paid instances. Each, here's the
kicker, to a minimum of $10 a month. So,
if you have 10 ideas you're playing with
right now, you could easily be paying
$100 a month for apps that have
literally zero users. In my case, and
I'm going to put like screenshots on on
the screen here somewhere. I got about
$80 a month before I knew that I had to
stop because this is insane. I would
happily pay hundreds of dollars for a
production app that makes me money and
has real users, but I refuse to pay $80
a month for an empty database just
because I don't want to delete or pause
it. Convex has a completely different
model. They only charge you for your
actual usage. And even in their free
plan, they give you 40 projects that
never freeze. This encourages you to
just launch new things, experiment, and
learn instead of wondering how big your
next bill is going to be because you
forgot about the three test projects
that you launched last month. But
pricing aside, there's a bigger issue
that most tutorials won't tell you
about, and it has to do with what
happens the moment your app needs to
talk to the outside world. Because
modern apps need help from external
services to work. Yours might be
processing Stripe payments, sending
emails with resend, or running AI
requests through something like Versel
AI gateway. In Superbase, this would
often require stitching together many
functions of code that run inside of
Superbase and even temporary internet
bridges just to test that the
notifications from Stripe actually work.
Trying to test a Stripe payment locally
while developing your app with Superbase
usually involves installing some
terminal tool from Stripe. Setting up a
bridge so the internet can access your
local development server. Putting this
temporary URL into your Stripe. Listen,
it's a complete nightmare even if you
are a technical person. But Convex
treats the backend, which is where all
your apps logic for external services
and your database live, as just more
code that it can read and control. So
your AI can set up payment notifications
or schedule things like daily automatic
tasks directly inside of your code. And
it works immediately without you setting
up any internet bridges or mini
functions of code. Convex can do this
because even though you build on your
computer, Convex automatically in the
background synchronizes your app into
their cloud. This was pure magic for me
when it first clicked because it just
makes it so your back end just works.
But there's one more thing that
separates apps that feel armature from
apps that feel like magic. And most
Superbase apps get this completely
wrong. Because let's be honest, users
today will expect your apps to be fast
or even better instant. If I change
something on my phone, I want it to
update immediately on my MacBook. For
example, this is called reactivity. And
in Superbase, making your app update
live requires a solid amount of extra
setup, code, and work. If you don't do
it, your users might be staring at
outdated data until they hit the refresh
button. Think about this example. Let's
say you have a Slack channel with your
team and your co-founder posts
something, but on your screen, nothing
happens. You're still looking at old
messages. So, you type a response to
something that they said over an hour
ago, hit send, and the page refreshes.
And suddenly, you see that they actually
answered their own questions three
messages back. With Superbase, this is
how your app usually feels to users,
unless you add extra code. And more code
means things can break more easily,
especially if you're non-technical.
Convex once again is built with
reactivity in mind. So every change
updates instantly. There's no refresh
button, no let me check if something
changed. It just works out of the box.
If anything changes inside of your
database, Convex will send this update
to your app, which automatically updates
what everyone sees on their screen. This
makes your AI app feel super modern,
super snappy without you doing anything
extra at all. To get started, download
my free starter guide in the description
down below. But choosing Convex is just
the first step. If you really want to
see the exact setup for building apps
that don't break, I created a video that
walks you through my entire process,
which you can watch right here.
