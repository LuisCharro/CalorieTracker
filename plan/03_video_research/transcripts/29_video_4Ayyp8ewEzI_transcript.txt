Two months ago, I launched my AI calorie
tracking app. And if I'm being honest,
it has not been the smoothest
experience. The profit margins were
rough because the AI costs were so high.
Most people stopped using the app after
a week. And I just wasn't sure if I
could turn this into something
sustainable. It's been about 2 months
and a lot has changed. In this video,
I'm going to share the real numbers,
revenue, profit, retention. I'll show
you how I dramatically improve my AI
bill, which then increased profit
margins, and all the changes that I made
to start moving the needle on retention.
If you're new here, welcome to the
video. My name is Chris and I build
productivity apps. I usually focus on
one productivity app per video and today
we're focusing on Amy. Quick context.
Amy is a calorie tracker in the style of
Apple Notes. You type the food that you
ate and we will magically calculate the
calories on the right. Probably the most
frictionless calorie tracking app out
there. So, let's talk numbers. We just
crossed $1,500 in monthly recurring
revenue. And that's on 148 paid
subscribers paying around $10 a month.
The last 28 days was $1,968.
For an app that's only 2 months old, I
am very happy with this. The revenue is
only half the story. The other half, the
part that keeps me up at night is the
cost. And if you're following along, you
know that the costs were really high,
but I'm proud to say we actually got it
down. My AI bill for the first month was
about $700, but this month we got it
down to $221. And that's with even more
users using the app. Reason the costs
are so high in the first place is I'm
using a very expensive AI model, Plexity
Sonar, to power the search and calorie
calculation. Every time someone logs a
food or makes an edit, we call this
model, which then cost me about half a
cent. I tried a bunch of different
models, but this is the best one I could
find in terms of speed and accuracy.
It's just kind of expensive. So, this is
the big thing that I've been working on
is getting this cost down. And I made
two major changes to do this. The first
is that I introduced a way cheaper model
for editing. Something I was doing that
wasn't good was I was using Perplexity
Sonar for everything. So, if someone
typed in food, we would call Perplexity
Sonar. It would do a web search. It'd be
really expensive. That makes sense. But
if they edit it, so let's say they write
burrito and they change it to half a
burrito, we call perplexity sonar again.
It does a whole web search and
recalculates it to make an edit. Super
unnecessary because for edits like this,
it's really just basic math. So I made a
modification where now when we make an
edit, we check is it just a portion
change? And if it is, we will send it to
a way cheaper model, which is Gemini 2.5
flash light, and it will go ahead and
recalculate everything for us. Instead
of half a cent, this costs like a tenth
of a cent. And a quick note because I
got a lot of questions after I posted
this online. Why couldn't I just do this
stuff programmatically? Why did I have
to use AI for the recalculation at all?
I did originally try that, but there are
so many edge cases because it's just a
free form text input. Like you can type
anything you want in here. So sometimes
someone would change one burrito to half
a burrito. Very easy to figure out, but
sometimes they change it to a couple
bites of a burrito. So I ended up using
natural language processing anyway to
figure out what was the portion change.
And at that point, I thought, might as
well just use Gemini 2.5 flashlight and
have it figure out the portion and do
the recalculation. Anyway, luckily the
model's super cheap. So, when you look
at the total cost for my bill, Gemini
actually ended up only being about $3 of
the bill. The second change I made,
which I believe had a way bigger impact
on the cost, was I added cashing. If
someone typed in burrito, we would go
run an expensive web search and call
perplexity and that would cost half a
cent. Now, instead, we're doing caching.
So, let's say they have typed burrito in
the past and they type it again. This
time it's going to check Supabase, which
is the database we're using, and we'll
see, okay, we already have the nutrition
info. We're going to pull that, and then
we'll use the cheaper Gemini model to
then just figure out all the portions,
which saves us from this very expensive
perplexity sonar call. I knew this would
make a difference, but I was not aware
of how big a difference that this made.
I think this was the bulk of why the
bill went from $700 to $200. And the
reason is because it turns out people
eat a lot of the same stuff every day.
60 to 70% of my calls are actually
hitting the cash now. I was anticipating
it would save like 20 30% in cost, but
it ended up reducing my bill by almost
70%. Now that I had a little bit more
breathing room on the profit margin
side, it gave me the confidence to work
on something I've been wanting to build,
but I kind of held off on because I was
scared of the costs. And that feature is
menu scanning. And it's a feature I have
not seen any other calorie tracking app
do. Here's why I built it. I noticed
that when I'm at a restaurant, yes, I
have the ability in Amy to scan a
picture of your food and then we'll
calculate the calories that way. But
sometimes I found that the menu actually
had really good descriptions of the dish
and I kind of just wanted to scan the
menu directly instead. But I held off on
building the feature because I didn't
want to make my already not so great
margins even worse. But now that I have
a little bit more breathing room, I
decided let's just go ahead and add it.
Now, when you're at a restaurant,
there's a new option where you can take
a picture of the menu. And we're using
Gemini 2.5 Flashlight to extract all the
items for the menu and kind of
reconstruct it in the app with the
description and even broken down by
section. And you can just tap the
relevant items and we'll add them into
Amy and calculate the calories. I think
this is one of the coolest features I
have added into the app. It's definitely
a magic moment for me. But I think when
people use this a couple times, that's
when they'll go from, okay, this is a
cool feature to I can't use an app that
doesn't have this. And again, because of
the cost, I don't think a lot of
competitors are going to be adding this
feature anytime soon. I am so happy with
how this feature turned out. By the way,
the way that I have been tracking all of
my costs, as you've seen, is through
Post Hog, and a huge shout out to them
for actually sponsoring this video. If
you've been following along, you know
that I've been recommending them way
before they sponsored the channel, and I
will continue to do so. But they are my
favorite tool for app analytics. I've
also been tracking all of my AI costs
with their LLM analytics feature. And
it's amazing because you can see total
cost, you can see the cost per model,
latency, everything is laid out here for
you. You can even see a breakdown here
that Perplexity Sonar is costing me $217
and Gemini is only $3, which is amazing
because now I have a benchmark of what
these models typically cost me in a
month. And if I see something like the
Gemini cost rising, for example, I can
go figure out, okay, is there something
wrong? It's also how I track things like
retention. So, I have a bunch of these
different graphs set up for all of the
important metrics like the download to
sign up rate, how many people are
turning on notifications, a bunch of
other metrics that I care about. I
seriously cannot imagine trying to build
an app and make decisions without Post
Hog. I'll leave a link in the
description if you want to check them
out and if you do sign up, please tell
them that I'm the one that sent you.
Since we're talking about metrics, let's
actually talk about the most important
metric that I've been tracking and that
is week one retention. If you've been
following me for a while, you know that
this is my northstar metric. It's the
percentage of people who after
downloading your app are still using it
one week later. And it's the best signal
that I have found to answer the
question, have I built something truly
valuable? When I first launched, week
one retention was about 3%. That means
that for every 100 people that signed
up, only three people were still using
it 1 week later. After about a month of
work, we did bump that number up to 8%.
Which is good. But the number that I'm
really trying to target is 30 40%.
That's where the really successful apps
tend to live. So a lot of the changes
that I've been making, the features I'm
adding, the bugs that I'm fixing are all
in service to try to move the needle on
that 8% week 1 retention. And I'm proud
to report that in the last month, we did
move the needle on that and went from an
8% week 1 retention to about a 10% week
1 retention. That might not seem like a
big change, but these percentages are
really hard to get. So, let's go over
some of the things that I changed to
move the needle on this. The first is
that there were a ton of small UX
improvements that I made. Now, it sounds
really boring, but it really does add
up. The less friction that an app has,
the more likely people are to stick with
it. I'll give you one example. I was
talking to users to try to figure out
what kind of pain points they were
facing, where the friction was.
Something that kept popping up was that
they love the photo feature where they
can take a picture of the food and it'll
go calculate the calories, but they wish
that they could edit the description
after the photo was taken. They said
that they would use the feature way more
if they had that ability, which kind of
surprised me because I was like, "Wait,
I definitely built it where you can edit
that description afterwards." Like, this
is an input box. When I told them, they
were like, "Oh, I had no idea. Thought
you couldn't really edit that." I'm
pretty sure they weren't alone. So, I
went ahead and added an explicit button
that says, "Is something wrong? Do you
want to make an edit here?" And now they
can type what edit they want to make in
plain English, and we'll update
everything for them. It's a small
change, but it really did reduce the
friction and made the photo feature just
that much better. I probably made about
10 UX changes that were similar to that
to try to improve the UX of the app.
Now, the second thing I added, which I
think is going to make a pretty big
difference to retention in the long run,
it's that I added proper weight tracking
with progress photos. This was hugely
requested. People wanted to be able to
track their weight over time, but they
also wanted to attach a progress photo
so they can see the changes physically
in front of them. Here's the strategic
reason of why I think this will make a
big difference and I took the time to
implement it. When people start storing
data in your app, especially data like
this, kind of like a journal, their
switching cost of changing to a
different app goes up dramatically. They
really don't want to lose all that
history when they move to a competing
app. It does really help improve
retention. The third thing that I added
was a better way to export data and also
better syncing with Apple Health. So,
we'll send even more data to Apple
Health. We actually have this Apple
Health integration where we can pull in
your steps, your workout data into the
app and display it. But Amy also has the
ability to send information to Apple
Health. So we send in the calories
consumed data to Apple Health so other
apps can use it. At the request of some
users, I made some improvements. So we
also send in how much protein you
consumed, how much sugar you consumed.
But changes like this and that ability
to export your data. This was made to
really build trust with users that
they're the ones that own their data
here. If users trust that they can
export and get their data out of the app
really easily, they'll be way more
willing to input data and invest the
time into building their data footprint
into your app, which again increases
retention. Now, the fourth thing I added
on the retention side was smarter
notifications. This one was actually
driving me crazy as a user of my own
app. Amy has notifications where we'll
send you reminders throughout the day
reminding you to log your food. But
something I hated was they did not take
into account if you already logged food
for that day. So let's say you log
dinner, then 30 minutes later you get a
notification saying, "Oh, reminder to
log dinner." So now it does take into
account where if you logged food for
breakfast or dinner, we're not going to
send you a notification for that. And
this matters a lot because notifications
are a huge, huge, huge lever when it
comes to improving retention. If you
bombard users and annoy them with
notifications and they turn that off,
that could have a dramatic effect on
retention. In the future, I actually
really want to make the notifications
even smarter where we'll take into
account your eating pattern so that we
can send you the notifications at the
right time. I was actually hoping to do
it this week, but then I realized I made
a huge mistake and I have not been
storing timestamps properly this entire
time. I did store the date, so I know
exactly what day someone ate their lunch
at, but I didn't store the time. So, I
have no idea when that actually
happened. So, I can't even build these
smart notifications. So, I fixed that
and now we are collecting way better
data. So, I'll give it some time and
then hopefully in the future we can
start building these smarter
notifications. But after all these
changes, the week 1 retention went from
8% to about 10%. 10.2% to be exact. I
know this doesn't sound huge, but
percentage points at this stage are very
hard to move. So, I'm actually really
happy with this number. And more
importantly, the revenue is going up,
the cost is going down, and I have a
pretty clear road map of what I need to
build next to move these numbers in the
right direction. The profit margin on
the AI stuff went from 50% to about 85%.
And when you factor everything else like
hosting costs and all the other stuff,
we're at a very sustainable and healthy
profit margin. Now, that's where we're
at 2 months in. Is it a massive success?
Not really, but it is working. I'm
learning stuff every single week and I'm
having way too much fun doing all of
this. If you like this kind of content,
