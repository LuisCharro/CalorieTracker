After six weeks of building,
documenting, and sharing progress, I'm
excited to say that Amy is finally live
on the app store. If you've been
following along, you've seen everything.
How I came up with the idea, the metrics
that I'm tracking, how I prioritize
features, everything to get to this
point. If you're new here, welcome to
the video. My name is Chris and I build
productivity apps. I usually focus on
one productivity app video, and today
we're focusing on Amy. Quick context,
Amy is a calorie tracking app in the
style of Apple Notes. You just type the
food that you ate, and then Amy will
magically find the calories and display
them on the right. In this video, we're
going to talk about everything I did to
get the app to the finish line. This is
a real unfiltered look of getting an app
from beta testing to live on the app
store. But I'll be honest with you guys,
I was not planning on launching this
fast. I actually wanted to do a few more
weeks of beta testing, but here's what
happened. If you saw my last video, you
know that I onboarded about 500 beta
testers, and there's still 1500 people
on the wait list who have not tried the
app at all. I was really hoping to get
it in their hands so I can test the app,
get some more feedback, but the costs
have been absolutely killing me. Right
now, I'm eating all the costs myself. I
am not charging any of the beta testers
while we test the app. And just in the
last week, I have lost about $300. And
I'm projected to lose a lot more than
that if I onboard those next 1500 users.
I really was hoping to do one or two
more rounds of beta testing, but I just
cannot afford to do it. So, I made the
call to accelerate things and push the
launch up to this week so I can start
monetizing and stop bleeding money. And
that's why this video exists. So, let me
show you what it took to get here. So,
at this point, we're actually pretty
good feature-wise. We have things like
widgets, we have streaks, and all of the
basic things you need for a calorie
tracking app. But there was one last
feature to add to the app, and that was
monetization. And the first question
was, how much do I charge for this app?
After a lot of thinking, I landed on $10
a month or $100 a year for the
subscription price of the app. I'll be
honest, this is a lot higher than I
wanted to charge. Typically, I start my
apps at $5 a month and then I just
increase from there as I add more
features and add more value. But the
cost to run this app were really high
because I'm using expensive AI models.
For transparency, if a user is using the
app correctly, the costs are going to
come out to around $4 to $8 per month,
which is really high. And in some cases,
for power users, the cost actually ended
up being $14 to $15 a month, which means
if I charge them a $10 subscription, I'm
actually losing money in these cases.
So, when analyzing all the costs, I
realized that $10 is probably the lowest
that I could realistically charge
safely. And I decided to go with a 3-day
free trial. I would have loved to do
seven, but to be honest, I don't know if
I can afford to do that. Once I decided
the price, the next thing I did was
design that payw wall. Studied a ton of
payw walls, and this is the design that
I landed on. Also added this really cool
animation where when you're scrolling
and you're trying to see all the
different features, a little cat will
actually pop up from the bottom. Pay
walls are usually not fun, so if I can
add something like this to make it a
little bit more enjoyable, I'll totally
do it. I posted the designs on Twitter
for some feedback, and the CEO of Super
Wall, which is a company that actually
just specializes in this kind of stuff,
gave me some really good feedback. One
piece of feedback actually stood out to
me cuz I had not seen this before and
it's adding something called a trial
timeline. The idea is to show users what
happens when they start the free trial.
So they're going to start the free
trial. It's going to notify them in 2
days in this case that the trial is
about to end and then on the third day
they're going to be build. Basically a
here's what to expect when you start
your trial. Personally, I really like
this. It sets the expectation for the
users and I think builds a lot of trust.
I took his advice. I broke the payw wall
up into three separate screens that
walks users through some of the features
they get and then they're hit with this
trial timeline and then eventually they
get to the actual payw wall. I don't
have any numbers to back it up because I
didn't launch with it, but I think this
is going to make a massive difference in
conversion. And then lastly, I added
this small section to explain why the
app costs the way it does. I have no
idea what this does for the conversion
rate and I've never seen anyone do it,
but it's just something that I wanted to
do personally for transparency. That was
the big last feature to figure out for
the app. And then the next thing that
was worked on was all the stuff you need
to actually launch on the app store. And
so I decided to work on the most
important thing, which is the app store
screenshots. This is something that I
constantly see developers overlooking.
And I get it, you just built an app. The
app store screenshots are the last thing
you want to work on. But trust me when I
say this, it is very worth it to put the
time into it because it is the first
impression users are going to have with
your app and it could be the difference
between them deciding to download it or
not to download it. So I cheated a bit
here and I roped my fianceé Ciccilia
into this because she's basically the
designer of the app at this point. She
helped me with these app store
screenshots and she absolutely nailed
the design. I'll show the screenshots
here so you can see them, but there's so
many little details and we chose to
specifically highlight different
elements of each of the screenshots. We
also chose to weave Amy the mascot in
this which adds so much character to the
screenshots which makes it really stand
out in the app store. And a quick tip
just from my previous experience
launching apps, if you plan on shipping
an iPad version, you do need to include
iPad specific screenshots. So spend some
time on that. But yeah, just one thing
that Apple sometimes rejects apps for.
Next, we decided to work on the landing
page. Right now, we have a weight list
page to collect emails, but now we need
a landing page to showcase the features
and drive people to the app store so
they can actually download the app. So,
quickly built this out. And to save
time, I actually based it on the other
landing page that I designed for my
budgeting app, Luna. So, it does look a
bit similar there. But, I'm really happy
with how this came out. I think it
showcases the app in a very beautiful
way and sets the tone for what users
should expect. Another important part of
the landing page is adding a terms of
service and privacy policy. And the
reason these are important, if you do
not have these listed on the payw wall
screen and throughout the app, Apple
will reject it. So, we had all of this
ready to go so that the minute we went
live, we would transition from this
weightless page to the landing page.
Next, I set up the email system. So, I'm
using a service called Loops. And this
is how I power everything email related
to the app. This is how I send the
welcome email, for example. But the
reason I set this up now is because I do
plan on adding very custom email
sequences. For example, a user signs up,
but they don't start a trial. What I can
do is actually send them an email to try
to convince them to start that trial. Or
let's say that they started a trial but
they didn't turn on the reminders. What
I could do is actually send them an
email a few days later saying, "Hey, by
the way, did you know that 70% of users
who enable the reminders actually stick
to their goals better?" I can send
emails like that. It may not seem
important, but from my experience
building apps, this actually has a
massive impact on retention when you set
this stuff up correctly. Almost forgot,
the last thing I added was the ability
for users to delete their account and
their data inside of the app. I've been
rejected from the app store before for
not having this, so decided to throw
that in there just in case. So after all
the prep work, I finally submitted it to
the app store. I was feeling really,
really good. I thought I covered
everything and then 12 hours later, we
got rejected. Now the main issue was
Apple did not like how I displayed the
yearly plan on the payw wall screen.
Based on feedback from the Twitter
thread, I decided to actually display
the yearly price in terms of the monthly
amount. So instead of showing $99 a
year, I decided to show $8.99 per month
build yearly. They wanted me to change
it. So the yearly was more prominent.
And so it said $99 a year and then the
monthly amount is a little less
prominent. There are a ton of apps that
do get away with this and then there's
some that don't. But honestly, the
rejection was not that surprising
because in my experience, 70% of my
rejections come from something related
to the payw wall. And I have no problem
changing this. I can see why this is
misleading. So I made the change and
then I submitted it for another review.
Another 24 hours passed. I was feeling
pretty hopeful and then got hit with the
second rejection. This time they said I
was missing the terms of service and the
privacy policy in my app description. I
have no idea why Apple requires this
because I already have it all throughout
the app, but that's the rules and they
rejected me, so I had to go ahead and
add that. Luckily, this one took me like
5 seconds. I didn't have to do any code
changes and I was able to resubmit it
quickly. After about 72 hours and two
rejections, I was eating at a restaurant
and I finally got the notification that
we were approved. I'm being so honest
here when I say that this feeling never
gets old. After all the hard work, all
of the preparation, all the rejections,
finally seeing this, I was just so so
happy. No more weight list. Amy is
finally live on the app store and I'll
leave a link in the description if you
want to go check it out. I didn't do any
big launch. I just did a simple tweet
letting people know it's live. Honestly,
it wasn't even that good of a tweet and
within the first day we had about 50
people start a trial. A lot of those
have already cancelled because I think
it's just other builders who want to try
the app and just see what it's all
about. So, they signed up, started a
trial, and canceled it in like a few
seconds. But, I'm looking at the data
and there are a few people who are still
sticking with it. So, hopefully some of
them do convert to paid users. But,
that's where we're at. And I'm very
excited you guys were able to see me get
here. Hopefully this was fun to watch me
go from literal idea and concept to live
on the app store first couple of trial
users. And hopefully in the next video
I'll be able to tell you guys we got our
first paid user. But I'll definitely be
sharing these numbers with you. We're
probably going to be looking at the
retention numbers, what the conversion
rate is from sign up to trial. Also be
taking you guys through what I plan on
doing for marketing. So a lot of fun
stuff planned. If you like this kind of
