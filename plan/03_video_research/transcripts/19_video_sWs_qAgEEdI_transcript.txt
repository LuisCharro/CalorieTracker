If you saw my last video, I spent the
last week building an app to get it
ready for the first 10 [music] users.
I'm excited to say we pulled it off and
there are now 10 people using the app. I
want to move quickly and capitalize on
the momentum we have. There's a lot of
interest in this app. There's like a
thousand people on the wait list. So, I
gave myself one week to iterate on the
feedback that I got, work on retention,
and make sure that the app was ready for
the next 200 users that I wanted to
onboard. I'll take you guys through what
I did this week, my thought process, how
I prioritize features like offline mode,
quick ad, and onboarding, and the steps
that I use to improve retention. If
you're new here, welcome to the video.
My name is Chris, and I build
productivity apps, and I try to document
everything I'm learning to share with
you guys on this channel. Okay, so real
quick, how did I get these first 10
users? I had a weight list set up the
minute I started building this app, and
that's my recommendation for anyone
building an app. Just get a weight list
out as soon as possible. So, I had this
weight list, and as I started building,
I was posting about it everywhere on Tik
Tok, on Twitter, on Instagram. That's
where I got the first few signups. So, I
got five people from the wait list and
then I picked five people that I knew
would give really good feedback. And
these were just people I knew from
online. Some of them are not necessarily
in the target audience, but that's okay.
I just needed some first reactions to
see if there was anything glaring that I
needed to fix. Once I onboarded these 10
people, the feedback started rolling in.
And the first thing that I heard was
people felt overwhelmed. They were just
thrown into the app. There was
absolutely no onboarding. And some of
them had used calorie tracking apps in
the past that asked them a lot of
questions like their height, their
weight, all this stuff. and they were
fully expecting that to happen here and
when it didn't they were kind of thrown
off. So I decided to build it and I
specifically decided to spend three
times longer on the onboarding than any
other app that I built in the past and
let me explain why. I was studying other
apps in the space and I even watched a
couple of interviews from other founders
who have launched calorie tracking apps
and something I noticed is they had
these really long onboarding processes
and in one interview one app was
mentioning that they noticed that the
longer the onboarding was the more
people tended to stick with the app
after they signed up which is really
counterintuitive because you would think
that if the onboarding is really long
people would get annoyed and they drop
off but it's a weird psychological thing
where they feel more invested as they
start going through those steps.
Onboarding is really tricky because no
one wants to go through it. So, we spent
a lot of time trying to figure out how
do we make this not feel like filling
out a form at a doctor's office, but
something people actually wanted to go
through. So, I spent a few days on this
and I got my fiance to help make
illustrations. So, these are handdrawn
custommade illustrations and she
actually animated them in Procreate.
Now, when you go through the onboarding,
you will see these custom illustrations
of Amy the cat in different poses
depending on what the information on the
screen is. And I'm so glad we did this
because now it is one of the most
complimented parts of the app. I am not
making this up. Someone actually said
that they signed up twice just so they
can go through the onboarding again.
That is not a normal thing and I think
it's because people were very drawn to
these animations and they were very
curious. Okay, what is the next one
going to be? So, they're actually
looking forward to it. I think it was
super worth it because it set the tone
that this was going to be a very high
quality app. So, that was the first
thing I ended up building, but there
were a ton of other issues that came up.
The next big one was stability. Users
were reporting that data was not saving,
the app would crash randomly. I felt
pretty bad about this, but honestly,
this is why we are doing this with 10
users and not a thousand users off the
bat. I had to rebuild a lot of the
underlying technologies to handle these
edge cases. And I wanted to share two
cool things that actually came out of
it. First is that I was able to quickly
support offline mode. Usually not
something that I support this early, but
two of the beta testers were actually in
New York City and they told me that the
app was not working in the subway, which
makes sense. There's no internet
underground, but since this is a notes
app and you never know when users are
going to want to quickly jot down what
they ate, I needed to support this edge
case. So now when you're offline,
there's a little indicator that says
you're offline. And now when you type
food, you'll see on the right that it's
being cued for processing when you're
back online. Before users would type and
then just nothing would happen and they
wouldn't know what's going on. Now they
can directly see, oh, it's cuz I'm
offline and when I come back online,
it's going to process again. Might not
seem important, but if I didn't have
that and a user typed and it just didn't
save or it failed. This is going to add
a lot of friction where they're not
going to trust the app and then they
would probably churn and stop using it.
Another cool edge case I fixed was time
zone support. So, I supported the
ability for users to change their time
zone. This also probably seems like
overkill. Why am I working at this
stage? But there was a user who was
reporting that they were traveling and
they noticed that when they changed time
zones, the food was just appearing on
the wrong day. I'm really glad I tackled
this early because I had to make a bunch
of database changes that would have been
such a pain if I had to migrate all the
data when I had a thousand users. So
much easier to make these type of
changes with just 10 users. Very glad
that that was caught. So, there were a
lot of these little features, but after
2 days, the app is way more stable.
After addressing all the stability
issues, I moved on to the next piece of
feedback. [music] Turns out people eat a
lot of the same thing every day, which
makes sense. I actually eat the same
breakfast tacos basically every single
morning. And they were getting really
annoyed that they had to type the same
thing over and over again each day. Made
this cool feature where you can actually
save certain meals and quickly insert
them with one tap. There's a meal that
you added you want to save. You can just
click this button and then on the top
right there's going to be an option to
save it. And then when you're in the
app, you can now click this button to
quickly add meals just instantly. This
is great if you eat the same thing every
single day for breakfast or you're
constantly having a protein shake, for
example, at random times in the day.
Perfect use case for this. And this is
great for me, too, because now I can
actually just reuse the nutrition data
and that'll actually save me an AI call
because remember, it cost me like half a
cent every time someone types something
in here. So, if I can avoid doing that,
I will 100% take that. I'm adding all
these features like the offline mode,
the quick ad. Why am I choosing to focus
on this stuff? And how do I know that
it's actually doing anything? Everything
that I'm choosing to work on is in
service of one key metric and that is
retention. Simply put, this is how many
people stick around and keep using your
app every single day. Every single
little friction that a user encounters,
whether it be the data not saving or it
shows the incorrect nutrition
information. All of this stuff does
degrade user trust and it causes them to
just stop using the app. Every time I
solve one of these things, it [music]
reduces friction which then increases
their chance of retention. So, the next
thing I implemented was the analytic
system to track retention. And if you've
been following my channel, you know that
I use Post Hog for all of my analytics
stuff. Huge shout out to them for
actually sponsoring this video. But
again, even if they weren't sponsoring,
this is the tool that I would be
recommending. I have another video
focused on analytics. I'll probably just
link it in the description below. So,
we're not going to go into that, but I
did want to take some time to show some
of the charts and the things that I'm
monitoring this early on to try to
improve [music] retention. This is stuff
that is really important to set up
before I onboard those next 200 users.
So, this is Postto. This is one of the
dashboards I set up. It's pretty empty
right now because there's not many users
using it. But these are the core graphs
that I'm right now looking at. So the
first one that's really important is I
want to see week 1 retention. The way
that you interpret this graph is this is
the percentage of people that stick
around every single day. We can see it's
October 31st at the time of recording.
Happy Halloween. There's 23 people that
signed up for the app at this point
[music] and at this time 100% of the
people are still using it on this date
which makes sense. They just signed up,
so technically they used it here. By
tomorrow, when I come back here, we're
going to see this percentage likely
change. Let's say that it's 50% this
next day. [music]
That means that 50% of the 23 people who
signed up on this day are still using
it. This is going to completely fill up
over the next week and it's going to be
really fun to see what the graph looks
like. And obviously, we want this number
to go up. So, as we start working off
user feedback and building features,
it's what we're going to be looking at.
Another important thing is how many
people after sign up are actually doing
the core action. And the core action
here is logging food. You can see here
that 23 people signed up and about 73%
of people ended up actually logging
food. And you might be wondering, well,
why would they not log food? I mean,
they signed up for this app. Why would
they not just go use it? Think about it
like this. This is a food app. What if
they signed up early in the morning and
they just haven't eaten anything that
day? There's really nothing for them to
log. So, there are a bunch of cases here
where it is very reasonable that someone
would [music] sign up and not actually
log anything or retroactively log the
food. And that's why it's really
important to set up things like
reminders, for example, because let's
say they don't log something
immediately, then 2 hours later I can
just remind them and hopefully that'll
get them to come back in the app and
then they actually will take the core
action. Something that I ask for on the
onboarding is I let people turn on
reminders. Something I want to do is
really make sure people are turning
those on. on. So, this is really
important, but you can see that 22
people signed up and around 50% of them
turned this on. So, something now I'm
probably going to work on is how can I
optimize this screen to get them to opt
in for those reminders. I will be
building out this dashboard to try to
add a lot more metrics that we're
looking at. But, this is a really good
start before I onboard those first 200
people. Another cool thing I want to
show with Post Hog is I'm using a
feature called LLM analytics. They also
have this really cool feature where they
integrate with the AI stuff. So, you can
actually track all of the costs [music]
that are happening in your app. And for
an app like mine where I'm trying to
figure out what to price the app, this
is really important. So that's how I'm
actually tracking all the cost. I'm
already using it to track the product
analytics and retention. I might as well
also use it for their AI analytics
feature. You can see here over the last
7 days, my costs have been around $5.
They have some other cool metrics here
like I can see what is the average cost
per user. It looks like it's about 13
per user at this point. This is going to
be a very important one for me to track.
Uh, and then if you have other models
that you're using, like I was testing
out a bunch of different perplexity
models. I can see which model is costing
the most. Very powerful stuff and I'm
really happy it lives with the product
analytics retention stuff that we were
looking at earlier. I'll leave a link in
the description if you want to go check
out Post Hog. I would offer a discount
code, but it is so cheap and I think
most people will probably stick under
their free plan to be honest. So, no
discount code, but if you want to
support the channel, please tell them
that I sent you. Okay, so let's keep
going with the features. The next piece
of feedback that I got from people was
sometimes the nutrition looked a little
bit off, but I don't really know how to
edit it. I have this really cool Amy's
thought process section that shows you
how it calculated the calories. If the
calories looked a bit off, what people
would do is they would just close it.
They would go re-edit the original food
and try to reprompt it almost, but that
was super annoying. So, I tried coming
up with a better solution, built this
feature where you can click a button and
then you can request edits on basically
anything. You can even just say
something like, "Hey, the calories seem
a little bit underestimated. can you go
ahead and just bump it up a little bit?
And then Amy will go ahead and do that,
show you the changes, and then you can
either reject or approve those changes.
I actually posted that initial concept
of this on Twitter, got a lot of really
good feedback. So, there's still a bunch
of improvements I need to make, but I
was able to get the initial version
shipped, and I'm excited to see if that
helps people out. And the last thing I
added before onboarding the next 200
people was a feedback board. I have a
feedback board in every single one of my
apps, and it is hands down the most
impactful thing that I have done for all
of my apps. For this app, I'm using a
tool called User Jot, and it integrates
directly into the apps. They go to
settings, they scroll down, and there's
a place to leave feedback. When they
click it, this page is going to open
with the board, and they're going to be
able to leave feedback, or more
importantly, upvote feedback that they
want to see. That means the most
requested features are just going to
naturally rise to the top and I'll have
a really strong signal of what I should
be prioritizing. Even though I just
implemented this and only a handful of
users have been able to use it, I'm
already very impressed with the type of
feedback that I'm receiving. I'm
incredibly excited to see what's going
to happen when I onboard the 200 people
and they get access to this feedback
board. I think we're going to see some
really cool suggestions in there. I am
not sponsored or affiliated with User
Jot. I'm just a fan of the product. So,
I'll leave a link in the description and
a code for 1 month free. I don't get
anything from you using the code, but if
you want to use it, I'll leave it there
so you can check it out. And that was
everything I shipped in the week. Huge
shout out to the 10 users who took the
time to beta test it. Thank you guys so
much for doing that. Next step is to
onboard the next 200 users. And we're
going to do the exact same thing all
over again. I hope this gave a good
glimpse into my building process, how I
think about feature prioritization, how
I improve retention. But if you like
