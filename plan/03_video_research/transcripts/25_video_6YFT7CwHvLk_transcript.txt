So, I launched my app last week and
decided [music] to track everything.
Revenue, trial starts, conversion rates,
all of it. And in this video, I'm going
to show you every single number, and
more importantly, everything I'm doing
next to improve those numbers. If you're
new here, welcome to the channel. My
name is Chris and I build productivity
apps. I usually focus on one
productivity app for video. And today,
we're focusing on my newest app, Amy.
Quick context. Amy is a calorie tracking
app in the style of Apple Notes. You
just type the food you ate and then on
the right, the calories will magically
appear. So, let's start with a number
that everyone is probably interested in.
How many people ended up subscribing?
What is the MRR or monthly recurring
revenue? One week into launch, we are at
around $400 monthly recurring revenue,
which is an insane number for the first
week. I've launched a ton of apps so
far, and to be honest, it took my first
app almost 2 years to get its first $400
in monthly recurring revenue. I made so
many mistakes back then. Honestly, could
make for a good video for me to talk
about those mistakes. So, let me know in
the comments if you want me to do that.
But so many mistakes and it took me 2
years to do that with the first app and
it took me one week to do it with this
one. I think this is a testament to all
the work that was put in before we even
launched the app. I spent 2 months
basically building up this weight list,
posting all over social media, showing
my progress behind the scenes of
building the app. Over 2,000 people
ended up joining the weight list, and we
got hundreds of thousands of views
across social media. So, I knew we would
get some subscribers on launch week, but
I did not expect it to be this many.
I've been getting DMs from people
saying, "This is actually an app that I
would use. I'm going to cancel my
current My Fitness Pal subscription and
switch to this." All of this has been
really validating, especially because
the app is priced at $10 a month, which
is pretty high for a calorie tracking
app. So, on the surface, revenue looked
really, really good. But then I started
looking at other metrics, and now I'm
thinking maybe it's not so good. Yes,
the $400 MR is a really, really good
number. I am super happy with this
number. But when I started looking at
other metrics, I noticed that it
probably could have been much higher. If
you've been following along, you know
I've been tracking everything in Post
Hog, and when I looked at the data, some
of the numbers were kind of shocking.
Let's start with the big one, which is
how many people after they downloaded
the app continued and actually signed up
for the app. Basically, how many people
inputed their email and got to the
onboarding steps? And that [music]
number is 40%. Which is absolutely
mind-blowing to me because I thought it
was going to be around 80 90% because
who would just download an app not to
sign up? But it turns out like 60% of
people would do exactly that. I have had
multiple people reach out and give
feedback saying you need to support
Google and Apple login, but I kind of
just dismissed it. To be honest, I
thought everyone would be fine with
email login because that's what I use
personally when I sign up for other
apps. But after hearing it enough, and
shout out to the people who gave me this
feedback, I decided to implement Google
and Apple login. And to be honest, it
actually wasn't that hard to implement.
It took me like an hour to do it. And I
also built it in a way where if someone
signs in with Google and they've already
signed up through email, it will combine
the two accounts. Since making the
change, around 400 people have
downloaded the app. And of those 400
people, all of them have actually signed
up and gotten to the onboarding stage. I
triple checked these numbers, and it is
actually correct. In hindsight, this
makes so much sense. Turns out people
prefer to use these methods because of
the decrease friction. Huge lesson. I'm
never going to ship a consumer app
anymore without these login methods.
Now, so that was the first big drop off
and the first big change that I made.
Second number I was looking at is what
is the conversion to trial rate. So, how
many people who signed up actually went
through and started a trial? And that
number is 5%. Which is actually not
great. I think the number we're looking
for is around 20 to 30% if not higher.
So, I started brainstorming, trying to
figure out how am I going to get this
number up. There's a bunch of things
that I can do to try to tweak the
onboarding and try to lift the number.
But another thing I could do was to try
to actually just make the app more
valuable and show people that it was
worth paying for. We have this feedback
board where people can submit feedback,
they can upvote the features that they
want to see. And I was specifically
looking for features that if I added
them to the app would make people go,
"Oh, yeah. This is a premium app. I
would pay for this app." And one feature
that was climbing the feedback board and
really got my attention was an Apple
Health integration. So, I thought, okay,
let's see how hard this is. Let me take
a stab at it. And I was very surprised
that it was pretty easy. And after an
hour, I actually got the full
integration built. So, now there's a
whole new section in the settings page,
and you can enable the Apple Health
integration. And it's going to do a few
things. First, it's going to pull in
your workout data, your steps data, how
many calories you've burned each day.
So, this is all information that's in
Apple Health. And now, we can display
all of this inside of the app. And the
other thing we can do is we can actually
send the calories consumed data to Apple
Health. So now other apps can use this
Amy data in their own apps. And I added
this new stats page which was a page I
was going to add anyway is a page that's
going to show you how many calories
you've consumed on a weekly basis. You
can also see stuff like how much protein
you've consumed for the entire week as
well. But I thought this is the perfect
place for other Apple Health information
to live. So if you scroll a little bit
down, you can see how many calories
you've burned for the week. You can see
your steps. You can see your workout
data. And we have this goals bar at the
bottom which shows you how many calories
you've consumed, how much protein you've
consumed. And I decided to tweak this so
you can now see how many calories you've
burned in the goals bar as well. But
here's the important part. After
building all of this Apple Health stuff,
I added it to the onboarding flow. So
now when users are filling out their
information, one of the things that
they're going to be prompted for is to
enable Apple Health. And again, the
reason I did this was not just to show
that the feature exists, but it's to
really signal to them that, oh yeah,
this is a very highquality app. Apple
Health integration itself might not make
a big difference, but if I keep adding
features like this, like an Apple Watch
integration, for example, and I make it
clear that this stuff exists on the
onboarding, all of that stuff will
eventually add up. There are thousands
of calorie tracking apps out there.
People are always switching. So, I
really need to fight and convince them
that this app has everything they need
and it's going to fit their workflow
better than anything else out there. By
the way, stuff like the Apple Health
integration usually would have taken me
like weeks, if not months, to actually
ship. But, I literally built this thing
in less than an hour. And it's because
I'm using tools like claw code and
cursor to build a hundred times faster
than I used to. If you look at my
prompts, they're pretty detailed. And
the way that I achieve that is by
dictating everything. I get a lot of
questions asking what tool I use for
dictation and the answer is Whisperflow.
And a huge shout out to them for being a
channel sponsor. Whisper is smart voice
to text that works in any application.
The reason Whisperflow is perfect for
developers is it understands technical
terminology. So when I say something
like
use state convex schema web hook handler
it gets it right every time. And if
you're using it with cursor windsurf
whisperflow actually has integrations
with these IDEs and it can actually
understand what's going on in the code
you're looking at and tag files. So
check this out. If I'm inside cursor and
I tell it please enhance the styles from
subscription overview.tsx, tsx
it will actually tag the file without me
having to type anything on the keyboard.
It's available on desktop so you can use
it inside of cursor claude chatgpt like
I do. So I'm constantly using it to
dictate things into claude or chatgpt
like I write very detailed YouTube
scripts and I'm just kind of dictating
everything. Typing all this out would
have taken me like 30 minutes. But with
whisper flow I'm able to do it in
seconds. You can use it on iOS as well.
I use it all the time when I'm
responding to messages. I'll leave a
link in the description and I have a
code that gets you one month free and
that's on top of the existing trial of
Flow Pro you get when signing up. They
did not do that. I'm the one that asked
for that. So, thank you to them for
providing that. The Apple Health
integration was one of the last changes
I made on the feature side. But, I also
got a lot of good feedback on
improvements I could make to the
onboarding so we can bump up that 5%
conversion number. Here were the key
changes and I'm going to be doing this
with all my apps moving forward. Maybe
you want to do it with yours too. But
the first was completely [music]
flipping the onboarding flow. So, right
now I have it where the user has to sign
up with their email or now Apple or
Google login and then they're hit with
the onboarding flow. I got this advice
from people and I double checked it. I
looked at a bunch of very successful
payw walls and onboarding flows and I
decided to completely reverse it where
now when the user clicks create account,
they're going to be taken immediately to
the onboarding flow. After they're done
with the onboarding flow, I'm going to
ask them to go ahead and make an
account. And the reason I'm asking them
to make an account is so that they can
save their data and so that they can use
it across multiple devices. And then
after they make an account, they'll be
hit with the 3-day trial and the pay
wall screen. Reversing this does seem
like a very small change, but again, the
number we're working with is 5%. [music]
If we can boost that 5% to even
something like 10%, that could be the
difference between 400 MR and 800 MR. So
any change that could potentially bump
this number up, I think is worth a try.
Second major change I made was to the
payw wall experience. If you look at the
current payw wall, there is actually an
X at the top right you can click to
dismiss it. One of the numbers I was
looking at was how many people click
that X. So how many people when they see
the payw wall, they just dismiss it
completely. And that number was around
60%. So 60% of people who see the payw
wall completely dismiss it and then I'm
assuming most likely churn from the app.
What I decided to do was actually make
it where when a user clicks that X, I
actually immediately give them a 24-hour
free trial. No credit card or anything.
I got a lot of feedback from people
saying that they wish there was a way
for them to try the app before even
starting the trial. And the reason I
initially did not do anything like this
was because I was scared of the cost. If
you remember, this app is costing me
about $300 a week just from the beta
testing. So, I was a little bit worried
about that. But after analyzing the
current cost and the revenue coming in
from the subscriptions, I think I now
can afford to offer this 1day free
trial. So, I thought to myself, if I'm
going to lose those 60% of people
anyway, if they click that button,
there's a very low chance of them
starting the trial. I might as well just
let them use the app and hopefully I can
win a few of them that way. So, these
were the launch numbers. We're at about
$400 monthly recurring revenue, which is
a huge deal. We had a 60% download to
sign up rate, which we then bumped to
100%. I think it's going to be 90%
realistically by the end of this. And a
5% trial conversion rate, which I really
believe will bump up with all of [music]
the changes that we've made. And all
these changes are important because I do
want to experiment with UGC marketing.
And obviously, if you're putting money
into something like that, you want the
highest chance of conversion because
it's such a waste if you invest money,
get people to download an app, and they
can't even get past the onboarding
screen. So any little improvement we can
make to these percentages does actually
matter. So that's where we're at after
one week. There were a ton of lessons
learned on my end. Hopefully there was
