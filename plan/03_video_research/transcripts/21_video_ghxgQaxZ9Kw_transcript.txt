My newest app, Amy, finally has 100
users. In this video, we're going to
cover how I got those first users and
then everything I did and built in just
one week to prepare for the next 500
users. If you're new here, welcome to
the channel. My name is Chris and I
build productivity apps and I document
everything I'm learning and share it
with you guys here on this channel.
Quick context, Amy is a calorie tracking
app in the style of Apple Notes. You
just type what you ate and then the
calories will magically show up on the
right. Probably the simplest calorie
tracking app out there. If you've been
following along, you know that I have a
weight list set up and I've been
actively promoting it while I've been
building this app. And that's my
recommendation is to start marketing and
promoting your app even before it exists
because now there are 1,600 people on
the wait list. This weight list is how I
got the first 10 users and it's how I
plan on getting the next 500 next week.
Okay, so here's what I learned now that
we have 100 users. The first 10 users
who use your app, you're mostly just
checking, does the app actually work? Is
there anything glaring that you need to
fix? Does the core functionality make
sense? But with 100 users, you start to
understand the most important metric in
my opinion, which is retention. Simply
put, retention is how many people stick
with and continue to use your app.
Because anyone can sign up, but getting
them to stick around is a whole other
thing. And specifically, the metric I'm
looking at is how many people are still
using the app one week later. You can
check out my last video if you want to
see how I'm tracking retention with Post
Hog and all the dashboard and metrics
that I set up. But after onboarding
these 100 users, right now, we are
sitting at about 3% week 1 retention.
That means for every 100 people that
sign up, three people are using it 1
week later, which is not great. But I
did a little bit of research and it
turns out in the calorie tracking space,
week 1 retention sits around 3 to 10% on
average, which is a bit lower than
expected. So I'll probably go double
check the numbers. But if this is true,
we are sitting at the low end at 3%. So
the mission became super clear. Can we
bump this week 1 retention up before we
release on the app store? Because you
really only get one first impression
with the user. They're going to download
your app and if they don't like it or
they don't stick with it, there's a very
low chance that they're going to try it
again. So, I gave myself one week to
improve the app, work on retention
before I onboard the next 500 users to
use the app. So, let's dive into what I
built to bump that number up. First
thing that I built, which I believe will
have probably the biggest impact on
retention this early on is widgets. Not
all apps can take advantage of widgets
because sometimes it just doesn't make
sense. But if your app can have a
widget, it is actually a cheat code for
retention. And here's why. It's cuz when
users are using your app, there are a
thousand other apps that are constantly
trying to get their attention. If you
have a widget, you take up a lot of real
estate on the user's phone. But more
importantly, it's way easier to get
their attention compared to something
like just an app icon on their home
screen. And to take it a step further,
you can even make a lock screen widget.
And this is probably one of the most
prized real estate on a user's phone
because only four apps are allowed to be
on that home screen at a time. So if you
are selected as one of those apps, that
means they're going to see your widget
probably 150 times a day. So in my case,
because I'm building a calorie tracking
app, let's say that I have a lock screen
widget. When the user opens their phone
and they see this widget, there's a
higher chance that they'll be reminded,
oh, I should probably go log my food for
today. I've done this with my other apps
like Luna, which has a lock screen and a
home screen widget, and my daily
planning app Ellie, which also has a
lock screen and home screen widget. And
when I implemented these, there was a
significant bump in week 1 retention.
So, I spent some time building this
widget, and I cheated a bit and got my
fianceé, Cecilia, to help me design
these widgets. So, shout out to her for
doing that. We have this really nice
illustration of Amy the Cat, which draws
people and grabs their attention when
they're on their home screen. And it
shows you how many calories you've
consumed for the day or how many you
have left, depending on your widget. And
there's also a little section that shows
the protein, carbs, and fats that you've
had for today. For the lock stream
widget, it's a little bit more limited
real estate, so we only show the
calories consumed or the calories you
have left for the day. Most important
part of the lock screen widget is it's a
place where when they tap it, it'll
quickly open the app so they can log
their food. This dramatically decreases
friction, which will then increase their
chance of actually building that habit
of logging their food every single day.
This is just a starting point. I have a
bunch of other plans for more widgets.
We got a couple more designs in the
works, but for now, for the sake of
speed, we're just going to ship it with
these core widgets to start. The next
thing I added was streaks. And this was
a feature purely to try to help people
to build this habit of logging. Because
if they use it for 2 days and 3 days,
there's a very high chance that they'll
continue to use it after a week. [music]
So, we added the streak counter that has
a calendar that shows you how many days
you hit your goal, how many days you
missed it, and then there's a counter at
the top that shows you how many days you
hit the goal in a row. And as a little
bit of a motivation boost, I also added
this badges feature. higher your street
goes, you actually unlock these badges.
And again, robed in Cecilia to help me
with this. So, she hand drew and
animated these in Procreate. So, these
are animated badges, and they're
actually based on a bunch of cat memes.
So, you can unlock these, and when you
tap them, you can actually see what the
original meme was. I know that
gamification like this might sound
gimmicky, but there's a reason that
Duelingo and Snapchat do employ [music]
this. I am still trying to tweak it to
figure out what the best approach to it
is, but I think there is a good way to
combine it with building this healthy
habit that can really be helpful for
users. I also want to mention that a lot
of these features like the gamification
and the widgets used to take me weeks to
ship, but I'm actually just shipping
these things in a single day. And it's
because I'm using tools like Claude Code
and Cursor to move 10 times faster than
I used to. If you look at my prompts,
they are pretty detailed and it's
because I dictate everything. And that's
my recommendation if you plan on using
AI tools. It's to just dictate
everything. You get way more detailed
prompts. I get a lot of questions on
what I use for dictation. And the tool
that I use is Whisper Flow. Huge shout
out to them for actually being a channel
sponsor. Whisperflow is smart voice to
text that works in any app. And the
reason I use whisflow is that it's
perfect for developers. It just
understands developer focused
terminology. So when I say something
like use state convex schema web hook
handler,
it gets it right every time. And if
you're using cursor or win surf
whisperflow has integrations with these
IDEs and it can actually understand
what's going on in the code you're
looking at and tag files. So check this
out. If I'm inside cursor and I say
please enhance the styles of
subscription-overview.tsx, PSX,
it will actually tag the file without me
having to type anything on the keyboard.
It's available on desktop, so if you're
using cursor, cloud code, or chatbt like
I do, it's there. But you can also use
it on iOS as well. I use it all the
time, especially when I'm responding to
things on iMessage or Slack. It's just
so much easier to just dictate
everything rather than typing the
message. I'll leave a link in the
description. There's a code for 1 month
free, and that's on top of the already
14-day trial that you get with Flow Pro.
They did not have to do that. I'm the
one that asked them for the code, so
thank you to them for doing that. So,
after building the cool retention
features like the widgets and the
streaks, I had to deal with some stuff
that was way more boring but equally
important, which was bugs. [music] After
onboarding 100 users, there were a lot
of them reported. And the reason I bring
it up is when people think about
improving retention, they usually only
think about features. But fixing bugs is
actually incredibly important because in
my case, for example, if someone's
logging food and there's a bug where it
just doesn't save, when they open the
app and see that it didn't save, they're
going to be very upset about that and
then lose a lot of trust and then
probably just stop using the app. Here
were some big ones that I believe had a
significant impact on retention. We have
this feature where you can actually edit
the nutrition info in line just by
asking it to make changes. When you
click this button, the keyboard will
open and you can tell it, hey, I feel
like the calories were a bit off here.
Can you just increase them? And it'll go
ahead and do that for you. The problem
was after you approve the changes, if
you close out too fast, the changes did
not persist. Imagine you're trying to
use this app and half the time it saves
and half the time it doesn't. I would
get so frustrated. I would definitely
stop using that app. And there were
other cases like this, too. Sometimes
the calorie calculation just didn't
fire. There were cases when you're using
the new quick ad feature to add a meal.
It wasn't updating the total calories at
the bottom. Just a lot of these little
things that did add up and compounded to
make a really frustrating experience.
Totally worth it. I think this is going
to have a huge impact on retention. So,
just sharing with you guys because if
you're holding off on fixing that bug
because you want to work on a shiny
feature, just know it probably does have
some impact on retention. And then there
were some more slightly embarrassing
discoveries like someone on the feedback
board actually asked, "Is there any
place where I can actually input my
current weight?" When I read that, I was
like, there's no way I forgot to put
this in the settings page. But I
actually did. Turns out I had a whole
settings page where you can input your
calorie goals, your macronutrient goals,
but I forgot to add a whole section
where users can type in their height,
their weight, the essential pieces of
data you need to calculate these health
goals. I completely revamped the
settings page. This is what it looked
like before. And then this is what it
looked like after when we finally added
this new section, which meant I had to
update the onboarding to also collect
this new information as well. I also
added the ability to switch between
metric and imperial units because over
half the users are actually using this
outside of the US right now. So just a
lot of little stuff that I really
overlooked, but I am so glad that we
caught before releasing because it would
have just been embarrassing to not have
this stuff on day one. All of this stuff
that I worked on was in service to try
to improve that 3% week 1 retention
metric that we have. But now we're ready
for the next 500 users. So I'm going to
onboard them and we'll see if that
number goes up. There's already so many
things I'm thinking about doing to
improve this number. Like I can improve
the notifications, which has a very
similar effect as adding widgets to your
app, improving the accuracy of the app
because if it's not accurate, people are
going to stop trusting and using it. All
these little things I'm very excited to
work on, but we'll probably talk about
that in the next video. Next week, we'll
probably talk about what happened after
I onboarded these 500 users. And then
hopefully after that, I think we should
be launching on the app store, which is
super exciting, and I'm very excited to
take you guys along with me. If you
